# PersonalProject: Personal Medical Tracker
This is the start of the assignment for our CS 291 class, creating a personal project

## Ideas for the personal Project:
- Personal Medical Tracker: allows you to track your medications and track any symptoms you may be having.

## Vision: 
- We want to create a project to create an app that will allow you to track your medical history for taking pills, adding symptoms etc.

## Inital Requirements:
Features:
- Log Medications: Track meds, log when you take them, send reminders
- Symptom Treacker: Log symptoms daily, rate them (scale 1-10), notes for doctors visit.
- Display Data: Display data tracked, identify trends between symptoms, medications, and other factors. 

## Architecture:
This app will be a mobile app, to increase ease of logging symptoms and meds. We will need a database to store user medical information, and a backend server to retrieve info from the database. 
- will be a mobile app
- will need a back-end
- will need a database
