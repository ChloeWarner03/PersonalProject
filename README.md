# PersonalProject: Personal Medical Tracker
This is the start of the assignment for our CS 291 class, creating a personal project


## Ideas for the personal Project:
- Personal Medical Tracker: allows you to track your medications and track any symptoms you may be having.

## Parts of the personal project:
- Medication Log: Add meds, mark when you take them, send reminders?(alerts when missed?)
- Symptom Tracker: Daily log for symptoms, rate them (scale 1-10), any notes for doctor visit
- Save Data
