# PersonalProject: Personal Medical Tracker
This is the start of the assignment for our CS 291 class, creating a personal project

## Vision: 
- We want to create a project to create an app that will allow you to track your medical history for taking pills, adding symptoms etc.

## Initial Requirements:
Features:
- Log Medications: Track meds, log when you take them, send reminders
- Symptom Tracker: Log symptoms daily, rate them (scale 1-10), and take notes for doctor's visit
- Display Data: Display data tracked, identify trends between symptoms, medications, and other factors

## Architecture:
This will be a mobile app to increase ease of logging symptoms and meds. We will need a database to store user medical information, and a backend server to retrieve information from the database. 
- will be a mobile app
- will need a back-end
- will need a database
